WordPress started out as a tool for blogging, but has evolved into a full-fledged Content Management System (CMS), capable of powering websites, networks and communities.</p>

Through the use of&nbsp;<a title="Using Themes" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes">WordPress Themes</a>, you can quickly change the look and style of your site. You can also extend WordPress’ functionality through the use of&nbsp;<a title="Plugins" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins">Plugins</a>.

Unlike remote-hosted scripts such as&nbsp;<a title="http://www.blogger.com" href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="http://www.livejournal.com" href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, you host WordPress on your own server. Installation is very simple, as is the configuration. Unlike other software programs, there are not a million files to&nbsp;<a title="Changing File Permissions" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">chmod</a>&nbsp;nor are there dozens of&nbsp;<a title="Templates" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Templates">templates</a>&nbsp;to edit just to get your site set up and looking the way you want.</p>
                                                                        <p>Also,&nbsp;<a title="Glossary" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blogging">Blog</a>&nbsp;pages in WordPress are generated on the fly whenever a page is requested, so you do not have multiple archive pages clogging up your web space. Waiting for pages to rebuild is a thing of the past because template changes are made in scant seconds.</p>
                                                                        <p>WordPress is built following&nbsp;<a title="http://www.w3.org/" href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>&nbsp;standards for&nbsp;<a title="Glossary" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#XHTML">XHTML</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Glossary" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CSS">CSS</a>, ensuring that your site is more easily rendered across standards-compliant browsers. Other browsers are supported with a few hacks; it’s a reality of the web that hacks are necessary.</p>
                                                                        <p><a title="Glossary" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#News_reader">Aggregator</a>&nbsp;support is built-in with a number of standard&nbsp;<a title="Glossary" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RSS">RSS</a>&nbsp;configurations already done for you, as well as&nbsp;<a title="Glossary" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Atom">Atom</a>. Following standards makes your WordPress site easier to manage, increases its longevity for future Internet technology adoption, and helps give your site the widest audience possible.</p>
